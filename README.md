This program will greet the user and prompt them for input in the form of two numbers. It will then validate that neither input field is empty, both are numbers, and that the length of both numbers match. After validation a variable (ex: var sumToCompare = 0) is initialized to store the sum of the first indexes. The program then iterates over both numbers, stores the sum of the first two indexes in sumToCompare, and then compares that to the other index sums. If they all match the program returns true. If they do not match on any iteration of the loop, the program will return false.
